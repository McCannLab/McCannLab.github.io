We have been relentlessly looking for answers to this question! Indeed, we did our best to determine whether global change has affected those communities over the last 40 years. It turns out that fish communities in Ontario lakes are pretty different from what they were, but climate change does not explain those changes 💥! But, but… how can we say that?</description></item><item><title>McCann lab in Federicton for the CSEE</title><link>https://mccannlab.github.io/post/2018/08/18/mccann-lab-in-federicton-for-the-csee/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Aug 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mccannlab.github.io/post/2018/08/18/mccann-lab-in-federicton-for-the-csee/</guid><description>They've made it 🎆!

Coding comes with challenges to be tackled to do science and good practices to be mastered to do reproducible science.
Git is a powerful tool that keeps track of earlier development stages of their code, it also ease the team work on a specific project. Technically speaking, is a Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS): every contributor has his one copy of the code, its complete history and comes with powerful tools to version your code, create branches, compare versions and branches, etc.</description></item><item><title>Publications</title><link>https://mccannlab.github.io/publications/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Feb 2018 15:36:56 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://mccannlab.github.io/publications/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Smart Food Webs</title><link>https://mccannlab.github.io/post/2017/04/11/smart-food-webs/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Apr 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mccannlab.github.io/post/2017/04/11/smart-food-webs/</guid><description>Smart Fish, as measured by relative brain size, are found in the food web in positions that are expected to maximize the stability of ecosystems
A food web is a map of species interactions describing who eats whom. The network of species interactions that comprise a food web are now known to be incredibly baroque entities that extend across a mosaic of habitat divisions and ecosystems. As an example, bears forage in oceans, rivers and terrestrial habitats blurring the lines between ecosystems.</description></item><item><title>Monitoring Biodiversity and Biostructure</title><link>https://mccannlab.github.io/post/2016/06/12/monitoring-biodiversity-and-biostructure/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Jun 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mccannlab.github.io/post/2016/06/12/monitoring-biodiversity-and-biostructure/</guid><description>A recent article by Dr. Bailey McMeans and others argues that there is a consistent response of biodiversity to human impacts, from individual level attributes to whole ecosystems. This integration across scales, seldom considered in a discipline often separated by scales suggests that there exists an overarching framework for biomonitoring ecosystems under human impact. The paper is is published in Ecological Monographs.</description></item><item><title>From modules to whole webs</title><link>https://mccannlab.github.io/post/2016/06/11/from-modules-to-whole-webs/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Jun 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mccannlab.github.io/post/2016/06/11/from-modules-to-whole-webs/</guid><description>Past lab member Dr. Gabriel Gellner, now in University of California Davis with Alan Hastings, publishes a theoretical paper on the role of growth, energy and interaction strength on modules to whole matrices with PI Kevin McCann (paper on researchgate). Gellner shows that while recent results have found potential differences that there is actually a consistent dynamical response (in terms of local stability analysis) from very simple low species models to speciose whole food webs.</description></item><item><title>Duality of Nature's Stability</title><link>https://mccannlab.github.io/post/2016/06/09/duality-of-natures-stability/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Jun 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mccannlab.github.io/post/2016/06/09/duality-of-natures-stability/</guid><description>A recent lab paper by ex Ph.D. student (now PDF with Alan Hastings) Dr. Gabriel Gellner on how there exist two types of responses to increased energy flow in the basic C-R interaction. This duality in response (excitable and non-excitable dynamics) are then used to delineate two qualitatively different types of response to stochasticity. This work surprisingly suggests that the Lotka-volterra with &amp;ldquo;noise&amp;rdquo; tends to behave very similarly to the Rosenzweig-MacArthur in that a stochastic Hopf (sensu Arnold; Fig.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://mccannlab.github.io/members/aidan_maloney/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mccannlab.github.io/members/aidan_maloney/</guid><description>I am an MSc candidate in the McCann and MacDougall labs, studying the relationship between bat activity and agricultural intensity in southwestern Ontario. This will broadly examine how a perturbation to the landscape, through homogenization, may result in a loss of asynchronous resource availability for a highly mobile generalist consumer. I completed my undergraduate degree at the University of Guelph, majoring in Ecology. I became interested in community ecology after taking the course Populations, Communities, and Ecosystems, which opened my eyes to the interconnectedness and balanced nature of biodiversity.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://mccannlab.github.io/members/alexa_scott/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mccannlab.github.io/members/alexa_scott/</guid><description>In the McCann Lab, I am completing a thesis based masters in Integrative Biology at the University of Guelph. While completing my undergraduate degree in Wildlife Biology and Conservation with a math minor, I became fascinated by how species coexistence can be modelled mathematically. Within my MSc, I am using theory to understand how seasonality may drive species coexistence. By altering seasonal lengths to resemble global warming, my research aims to investigate if and how competitive species can coexist in the face of climate change</description></item><item><title/><link>https://mccannlab.github.io/members/brandon_graham/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mccannlab.github.io/members/brandon_graham/</guid><description/></item><item><title/><link>https://mccannlab.github.io/members/carling_bieg/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mccannlab.github.io/members/carling_bieg/</guid><description>I am a PhD student in the McCann Lab, co-advised by Evan Fraser from the Department of Geography. I use theory to understand ecosystem functioning in order to preserve both ecological stability and food production in the face of global change (e.g., climate change, land development and food production/harvesting). My past research has focused on patterns in global fisheries and resulting food web dynamics, and I am now extending this by developing general theory that can be applied to many ecosystem types, from temperate rivers to tropical flood plains and coral reefs.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://mccannlab.github.io/members/charlotte_ward/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mccannlab.github.io/members/charlotte_ward/</guid><description/></item><item><title/><link>https://mccannlab.github.io/members/christopher_greysongaito/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mccannlab.github.io/members/christopher_greysongaito/</guid><description>I am fascinated by systems; how they function, what structures them, and what causes them to fail. My favourite systems are ecological systems and my specific research focus is ecological food webs. However, I see myself as highly interdisciplinary and am interested in the intersection of ecology with evolution, politics, and economics. My main research tool is mathematical modelling, but I also collaborate with empiricists regularly.
For my PhD, I am examining the interactions of ecological processes across scales in a variety of systems.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://mccannlab.github.io/members/emily_champage/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mccannlab.github.io/members/emily_champage/</guid><description/></item><item><title/><link>https://mccannlab.github.io/members/gabriel_gellner/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mccannlab.github.io/members/gabriel_gellner/</guid><description>I study the structure and functions of food webs to better understand our environment and biological complexity. Topics include theoretical ecology, population biology and how biodiversity affects ecological systems. As well, I’m interested in where the ideas and methods of theoretical ecology and ecoinformatics come from, and how they are applied.

I regard myself as a theoretician motivated by a strong desire to apply the results of abstract investigations to tangible challenges such as the impact of global change on ecological communities.
During my PhD, I investigated the relationship between biotic interactions and species co-occurrence. Even though the role of species interactions have been been early pointed out as a major contributor to species's range limits, researchers are still struggling to find adequate approaches that appropriately combine abiotic and biotic factors to better predict tomorrow's biodiversity.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://mccannlab.github.io/members/marie_gutgesell/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mccannlab.github.io/members/marie_gutgesell/</guid><description>I am a PhD student in the McCann Lab.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://mccannlab.github.io/members/reilly_oconnor/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mccannlab.github.io/members/reilly_oconnor/</guid><description>I am an MSc candidate in the McCann Lab, studying spatial and temporal population dynamics of zooplankton in Lake Simcoe, ON. I completed my undergraduate degree at the University of Guelph in Marine and Freshwater Biology with a minor in Ecology. Throughout my degree, I became interested in lake food web ecology through working on Lake Huron as a field and lab technician in the McCann Lab. Currently, I am looking at how variation in densities of the Lake Simcoe zooplankton community have changed since 1986.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://mccannlab.github.io/members/timothy_bartley/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mccannlab.github.io/members/timothy_bartley/</guid><description>I am a food web ecologist studying the causes and consequences of food web reorganization with global environmental change.
Currently, I am postdoctoral fellow at the University or Toronto Mississauga and the University of Guelph. I am integrating a range of empirical data, primarily from the Great Lakes and other aquatic ecosystems, to document how the organisms&amp;rsquo; responses to global environmental change are &amp;lsquo;rewiring&amp;rsquo; food webs. I am also developing theoretical models to explore how this food web rewiring impacts stability.</description></item><item><title>Contact</title><link>https://mccannlab.github.io/contact/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mccannlab.github.io/contact/</guid><description>Kevin S.

This question naturally leads to understanding how human impacts alter biological structure and so also how impacts may potentially alter the stability and functioning of whole ecosystems. This latter aspect of human impacts brings has our empirically motivated interests in developing practical biomonitoring techniques that span the ecological hierarchy.</description></item></channel></rss>
