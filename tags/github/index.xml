This week, our &amp;ldquo;Labmnivory&amp;rdquo; paper led by Marie Gutgesell has been accepted in Bioscience. Therefore, the time has come to release the code we promised explicitly in the manuscript.
Code for theoretical investigations will be made available on GitHub and archive on Zenodo upon manuscript acceptance.
For reproducibility&amp;rsquo;s sake, we&amp;rsquo;ve structured our Julia&amp;rsquo;s scripts as a research compendium which so far has been hosted on GitHub, in a private repository.</description></item><item><title>Git, GitHub &amp; GitKraken</title><link>https://mccannlab.github.io/post/2018/05/18/git-github-gitkraken/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 May 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mccannlab.github.io/post/2018/05/18/git-github-gitkraken/</guid><description>Context With the increasing amount of data available and the increasing complexity of statistical analyses, nowadays a PhD in ecology often requires programming skills. Coding comes with challenges to be tackled to do science and good practices to be mastered to do reproducible science.
Git is a powerful tool that keeps track of earlier development stages of their code, it also ease the team work on a specific project. Technically speaking, is a Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS): every contributor has his one copy of the code, its complete history and comes with powerful tools to version your code, create branches, compare versions and branches, etc.</description></item></channel></rss>
